# Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes or vertex (elements), and edges(connections).

## Types of graphs

- **Directed graph** where in edges have direction
- **Undirected graph** where in edges doesn't specify direction

## Representations of graphs

- **Adjacency list** a key-value map where in every keys are the nodes and the values are [arrays](array.md) of neighbors

## Graph Algorithm

- **Traversal algorithm** algorithm to traverses graphs
  - [depth first traversal](depth-first-traversal.md)(DFS)
  - [breadth first traversal](breadth-first-traversal.md)(BFS)
